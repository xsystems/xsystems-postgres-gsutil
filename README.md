# xSystems PostgreSQL gsutil

> A PostgreSQL image containing the _**gsutil**_ application that lets you access Google Storage from the command line.

## Usage

### Run

[Create a GCP service account][gcp-service-account-create] and [create a key for that service account][gcp-service-account-key].
Next, [assign the service account the role][gcp-bucket-level-policy-member] **Storage Admin** w.r.t. the Google Cloud Storage bucket. 

> **NOTE:** Make sure that, on Unix systems, the permissions on the before mentioned credential file are set to `0400`. 
>           For example, to achieve this run: `chmod 0400 gcp-credentials.json`

When running a container of this image you **MUST** mount the before mentioned credential file under `/run/secrets/` inside the container.
That is, the following file **MUST** be available inside the container:

  - `/run/secrets/gcp-credentials.json`

This can either be achieved using Docker Volumes or Docker Secrets.

Also, when running a container of this image you **MUST** specify the environment variable `GCP_PROJECT`.

All available environment variables are:

| Environment Variable        | Default Value | Required  | Description                                                                                 |
| :-------------------------- | :------------ | :-------: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| GCP_PROJECT                 |               |     âœ”    | The Google Cloud _**Project ID**_ of the project the Google Cloud Storage Bucket is part of |


### Example

This image can be used as follows:

```sh
docker run  --tty \
            --interactive \
            --rm \
            --env GCP_PROJECT=<REPLACE_WITH_PROJECT_NAME> \
            --volume `pwd`/gcp-credentials.json:/run/secrets/gcp-credentials.json \
            xsystems/postgres-gsutil ls -al gs://<REPLACE_WITH_BUCKET_NAME>
```


## Build the Image

Run [build.sh](build.sh) to build an image of the current codebase state with tag `latest`.


## Release the Image

1. Set the `VERSION` environment variable to the version that needs to be released.
2. Optionally, set the `COMMIT` environment variable to the hash of the Git commit that needs to be released. It defaults to the latest commit.
3. Run [release.sh](release.sh).

```sh
